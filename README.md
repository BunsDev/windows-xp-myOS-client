## Introduction

Welcome to myOS, a virtual desktop environment inspired by the iconic Windows XP operating system! This project aims to recreate the nostalgic Windows-XP desktop experience using modern web technologies. With the combination of React, PostgreSQL, and other powerful tools, myOS allows users to interact with desktop icons, open applications, create and save files, and relive the charm of the classic Windows OS.

## Live Demo

## Features

- **Authentic Windows-XP Desktop Interface**: myOS faithfully replicates the familiar Windows-XP desktop user interface, complete with interactive desktop icons, creating a genuine retro feel.

- **Program Launching**: Each desktop icon corresponds to a specific application, enabling users to launch various applications, such as Calculator, Pokedex, Connect Four, AOL Instant Messenger (powered by SmarterChild AI), Internet Explorer, and Notepad.

- **Fully Functional Calculator**: Perform arithmetic operations with ease using the integrated Calculator app.

- **Pokedex App**: Embark on a Pokémon journey with the Pokedex app, allowing you to explore and search for information about your favorite Pokémon.

- **Connect Four Game**: Engage in a classic Connect Four game and challenge your friends for some friendly competition.

- **AOL Instant Messenger with SmarterChild AI**: Chat with the legendary SmarterChild AI, now powered by the OpenAI API, and enjoy interactive and intelligent conversations reminiscent of the AOL Instant Messenger days. Export your chat logs, access them anytime via the Notepad application.

- **Internet Explorer Inspired Browser**: Experience the early internet vibes with the Internet Explorer-inspired application, where you can browse the web and explore online content.

- **Notepad**: Create, save, and retrieve text files using the Notepad app, just like you did in the good old days.

- **Settings**: Personalize your myOS experience with the Settings section. Choose from a selection of nostalgic Windows-XP inspired wallpapers to customize your virtual desktop background.

## Built by Me

Everything in this virtual environment, including each application and its functionalities, has been meticulously designed and developed by me. From the user interface to the backend logic, I have put in the effort to recreate the nostalgic Windows-XP experience and ensure a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

The development of myOS - Windows-XP Inspired Virtual Desktop Environment - involved the seamless integration of various modern web technologies, frameworks, and tools. Here are the key technologies used in the creation of myOS:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, React's component-based architecture and efficient rendering provided a smooth and responsive user experience.

- **Bootstrap**: A front-end CSS framework, Bootstrap was employed to ensure consistent styling, responsiveness, and cross-device compatibility for the virtual environment.

- **bcryptjs**: Used for secure password hashing, bcryptjs helped protect user credentials in the authentication process.

- **axios**: A popular HTTP client for making API requests, axios facilitated communication with the server and external APIs.

- **moment**: A JavaScript library for manipulating dates and times, moment allowed for easy handling and formatting of time-related data.

- **OpenAI API**: The powerful OpenAI API was integrated to enhance the AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) application by powering the legendary SmarterChild AI. This AI-driven conversation engine allowed users to engage in intelligent and nostalgic chat sessions.

- **use-sound**: A library for adding sound effects to web applications, use-sound added auditory feedback to interactions within the virtual environment.

- **react-draggable**: This library enabled the interactive movement of desktop icons and windows across the virtual desktop.

- **Sequelize**: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool, Sequelize facilitated interaction with the PostgreSQL database, simplifying the management of the database schema and enabling easy data manipulation.

- **PostgreSQL**: As the chosen database, PostgreSQL provided a robust and reliable solution for storing various data, including chat logs, text files, and user preferences.

- **ElephantSQL**: A cloud-based PostgreSQL service, ElephantSQL allowed for easy database management and hosting.

The harmonious integration of these cutting-edge technologies allowed myOS to capture the essence of the iconic Windows XP operating system while offering new features and a seamless user experience in a virtual desktop environment.

## Backend API

The backend API for myOS is located in a separate repository at [https://github.com/kevinleet/myOS-API](https://github.com/kevinleet/myOS-API). This repository contains the server-side code responsible for handling data and supporting various functionalities in the virtual environment.
