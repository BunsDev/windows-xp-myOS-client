## Built by Me

Everything in this virtual environment, including each application and its functionalities, has been meticulously designed and developed by me. From the user interface to the backend logic, I have put in the effort to recreate the nostalgic Windows-XP experience and ensure a seamless user experience.

## Backend API

The backend API for myOS is located in a separate repository at [https://github.com/kevinleet/myOS-API](https://github.com/kevinleet/myOS-API). This repository contains the server-side code responsible for handling data and supporting various functionalities in the virtual environment.
